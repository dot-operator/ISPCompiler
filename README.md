# ISPCompiler
C-ish Compiler project for Independent Study Project (NCF, 2019).
It outputs something approaching a three-address Intermediate Representation after parsing the file into a syntax tree.

The parser supports most of C's grammar barring pointers, with a somewhat limited implementation of declarations.
